## User service

Implemented the [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) service that handle the following
features

- Signup
- Login
- Authorization
- Get User's info

### Signup

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant u as User
participant h as HTTP Gateway
participant us as User Service
participant db as golden_pay_db
participant k as Event Queue

u->>h: PUT api/v1/signup
h->>us: RPC signup
us->>db: insert new User
us->>k: push new_user event
```

### Login

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant u as User
participant h as HTTP Gateway
participant us as User Service
participant db as golden_pay_db

u->>h: POST api/v1/login
h->>us: RPC login
us->>db: get User
us->>h: resp JWT token
h->>u: SetCookie JWT token
```

### Authorization

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant u as User
participant h as HTTP Gateway
participant us as User Service

u->>h: POST api/v1/authz
h->>us: RPC authz
```

## Wallet service

Implemented the [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) service that handle the following
features

- Transfer
- Topup
- Get user's transactions
- Process Transfer
- Create wallet

### Transfer

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant u as User
participant h as HTTP Gateway
participant us as User Service
participant ws as Wallet Service
participant db as golden_pay_db
participant k as Event Queue

u->>h: PUT api/v1/users/transactions
h->>us: RPC authz
h->>ws: RPC transfer
ws->>db: get wallet FOR UPDATE
ws->>db: update from_user's wallet
ws->>db: insert new transaction
ws->>k: push new_transaction event
```

### Topup

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant u as User
participant h as HTTP Gateway
participant us as User Service
participant ws as Wallet Service
participant db as golden_pay_db

u->>h: POST api/v1/users/topups
h->>us: RPC authz
h->>ws: RPC topup
ws->>db: get wallet FOR UPDATE
ws->>db: update wallet
ws->>db: insert new topup
```

### Get user's transactions

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant u as User
participant h as HTTP Gateway
participant us as User Service
participant ws as Wallet Service
participant db as golden_pay_db

u->>h: GET api/v1/users/transactions
h->>us: RPC authz
h->>ws: RPC get_user_transactions
ws->>db: query order by id desc
```

### Process Transaction

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant e as Event Handler
participant k as Event Queue
participant ws as Wallet Service
participant db as golden_pay_db

e->>k: poll
e->>ws: RPC process_transaction
ws->>db: get wallet FOR UPDATE
ws->>db: update to_user's wallet
```

### Create Wallet

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant e as Event Handler
participant k as Event Queue
participant ws as Wallet Service
participant db as golden_pay_db

e->>k: poll
e->>ws: RPC create_wallet
ws->>db: insert wallet
```

## Event handler

- Listen to `new_user` event to create user's wallet
- Listen to `new_transaction` event to verify and process a transaction to move
  it from `pending` to `success` or `rejected`
