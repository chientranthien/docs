## 🧠 Building a Sharing Culture: How “1-Week-1-Sharing” Transformed My Team

### 🏁 Why I Started It

As a team leader, I’ve always believed that consistent knowledge sharing is key
to team growth. But in fast-paced environments, it's easy for learnings to stay
siloed. To combat this, I started a simple practice during our weekly meetings:
a segment called **“1-Week-1-Sharing.”**

The idea was straightforward:

> Every week, one team member shares something useful—big or small—with the rest
> of the team.

### ⏱ What It Looks Like

* **Frequency:** Once a week, during our regular team meeting
* **Duration:** From a 5-minute quick tip to a 30-minute deep dive
* **Topics:** Anything that helps us work better such as technical tips, command-line
  tricks, process improvements, debugging techniques, or even mindset shifts

### 💡 The Early Challenges

In the beginning, I led most of the sharings myself. While I enjoyed it, it
wasn’t sustainable and it wasn't the point. I wanted the *team* to share with
each other, not just absorb from me.

Some challenges I faced:

* Team members were unsure what to share
* People hesitated due to fear of being judged or not having "enough" to say
* It was hard to keep momentum week after week

### 🚀 What Made It Work

Over time, a few things helped build traction:

#### 1. **Lowering the Barrier**

I emphasized that even a small tip can make a big impact. A command-line
shortcut or a quick IDE trick can save hours over time.

#### 2. **Creating a Sharing Roster**

I introduced a lightweight rotation schedule. This gave people time to prepare
and made sharing feel like a team norm, not a request.

#### 3. **Offering Prompts**

When people didn’t know what to share, I’d suggest:

* “What’s something new you learned this week?”
* “Any ‘aha!’ moment while debugging?”
* “A tool or shortcut you use often?”

#### 4. **Following Up**

After each session, I’d casually follow up to see if others had applied the tip.
It helped reinforce the value of the sharing and encouraged repeat
participation.

### 🌱 The Impact

The results have been energizing:

* We’ve built a stronger learning culture
* Team members feel more connected and empowered
* Knowledge spreads faster, no need to reinvent the wheel
* Our productivity has genuinely improved through shared tips

It also made our team meetings more dynamic and engaging.

### 📝 Final Thoughts

“1-Week-1-Sharing” isn’t complex, but its impact is real. You don’t need a grand
program or fancy tools. All it takes is consistency, encouragement, and a belief
that every team member has something valuable to contribute.

If you're a leader, give it a try. Start small. Share first. And watch the
culture shift over time.
