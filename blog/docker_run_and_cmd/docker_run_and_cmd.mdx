## Background

If you're new to `Docker` you may feel confused of the `RUN` and `CMD` command
in the Docker file. Because they both seem to execute a command line. Like in
the example below the `RUN cd /wrk` is to execute the command line "move to /wrk
folder" and the `CMD ./bin/user/exc` is to execute the `exc` binary file. So
what are the differences between them?

```dockerfile
FROM chientt1993/golang:1.19
RUN ln -sf /bin/bash /bin/sh

WORKDIR /wrk
COPY . /wrk
RUN cd /wrk
ARG G_ENV=dev
RUN if [[ "$G_ENV" = "prod" ]] ; then make build/user ; else echo "building for dev env, only copy from local bin" ; fi

RUN mkdir tmp; mv bin/user tmp/user ; rm bin/* -r; mv tmp/user bin/user

CMD ./bin/user/exc
```

## Key Differences Between `RUN` and `CMD`
|                  | RUN                                                                      | CMD                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Execution Timing | image build process                                                      | when a container is started                                                                         |
| Purpose          | install dependencies, copy files, set up environment                     | to launch a runtime application or service                                                          |
| Outcome          | Changes made by `RUN` commands are persisted as a new layer in the image | `CMD` is called when a container is started. So changes made by `CMD` command will not be persisted |
| Others           | it can have multiple `RUN` commands                                      | only the last `CMD` is executed                                                                     |

```note
Docker also has `ENTRYPOINT` command which is similar to `CMD` except that
`ENTRYPOINT` command can't be overrided by `docker run <new command> .
```
