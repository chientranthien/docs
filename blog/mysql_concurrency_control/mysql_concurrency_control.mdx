## Concurrency Control with MySQL: A Practical Guide

In high-performance applications, maintaining data integrity in the face of
concurrent access is both a necessity and a challenge. MySQL, as one of the most
widely used relational databases, provides several mechanisms to handle
concurrency, but understanding how and when to use them effectively is critical.

In this post, we‚Äôll explore **pessimistic** and **optimistic** concurrency
control strategies with MySQL, drawn from real-world insights and practical
architecture considerations.

## Why Concurrency Control Matters

Concurrency issues arise when multiple transactions access the same data
simultaneously. Without proper control, this can lead to classic problems such
as: wo transactions overwrite each other‚Äôs changes.


## Pessimistic vs Optimistic Concurrency

Concurrency control mechanisms generally fall into two categories:

### üîí Pessimistic Locking

Pessimistic concurrency assumes that conflicts are likely. It **locks** data
before accessing it, ensuring only one transaction can operate on the data at a
time. This is achieved using:

* `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`: Acquires an **exclusive lock** on selected rows.
* `LOCK IN SHARE MODE`: Acquires a **shared lock**, allowing concurrent reads
  but not writes.

#### Example: Safe Decrement with Pessimistic Locking

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT stock FROM items WHERE id = 42 FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE items SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = 42;
COMMIT;
```

This pattern is useful in inventory management to prevent overselling.

**Pros**:

* Guarantees safety in high-contention scenarios.
* Easy to understand.

**Cons**:

* Can cause lock contention and reduced throughput.
* Risk of deadlocks if not managed properly.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Optimistic Locking

Optimistic concurrency assumes conflicts are rare. Instead of locking data
preemptively, it verifies that no changes have occurred during the transaction
before committing.

Typically, this involves a **version column** in your table:

#### Example: Version-based Update

```sql
UPDATE items
SET quantity = quantity - 1,
    version  = version + 1
WHERE id = 42 AND version = 5;
```

If another transaction modified the row and incremented `version`, this update
will fail and can be retried.

**Pros**:

* Better performance under low contention.
* Avoids blocking other transactions.

**Cons**:

* May require retries.
* Can lead to unexpected failures if not handled correctly.

## Choosing the Right Strategy

| Strategy    | Best For                                               | Trade-offs                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Pessimistic | High contention scenarios (inventory, booking systems) | Blocks other transactions, potential deadlocks |
| Optimistic  | Read-heavy workloads with rare conflicts               | Requires retries, more complex logic           |
